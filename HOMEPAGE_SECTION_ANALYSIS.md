## 🎯 RECOMMENDED NEXT SECTION: **"About Us / Company Story"**

### Why This Section Should Be Next:

#### 1. **User Journey Logic** ✨
After seeing the hero and client logos (TrustBar), visitors need to understand:
- **WHO you are** (credibility)
- **WHAT you do** (value proposition)
- **WHY they should care** (differentiation)

This is the natural progression in the conversion funnel: Attention → Interest → Desire → Action

#### 2. **SEO Benefits** 🔍
- **E-E-A-T Signals**: Establishes Expertise, Experience, Authoritativeness, and Trustworthiness
- **Keyword Opportunities**: Company name, location-based keywords, industry terms
- **Dwell Time**: Engaging storytelling keeps visitors on page longer
- **Internal Linking**: Natural place to link to team, services, portfolio
- **Schema Markup**: Organization schema, LocalBusiness schema

#### 3. **Customer-Centric Value** 💼
Modern B2B buyers want to know:
- Your company's mission and values
- Your unique approach/methodology
- Your experience and track record
- Your team's expertise
- Your location and global reach

#### 4. **Conversion Psychology** 🧠
- **Trust Building**: People buy from companies they know and trust
- **Emotional Connection**: Story-driven content creates emotional bonds
- **Social Proof**: Mention years in business, clients served, projects completed
- **Differentiation**: Clearly state what makes you different from competitors
